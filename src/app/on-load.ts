Welcome to the YouWol collaborative lab for consuming or producing web applications. 
This space (the \`@youwol/co-lab\` application) lets you explore your lab's content.

At its core, the lab collects executable units, or components, treating them as independent entities that dynamically
 assemble during the execution of applications or user scripts. These components range from those interpreted in the
  browser, like JavaScript, WebAssembly, or Python via the Pyodide wrapper, to those processed on a PC as backends. 
  Your lab grows as it automatically acquires components encountered during browsing or from your own project 
  publications. 

Collaboration is seamless in this ecosystem: when components are needed to run an application, 
the system ensures the most up-to-date, compatible version is used, whether sourced from your ongoing projects
 or the broader YouWol network through updates. New or missing components are efficiently downloaded, 
 enhancing performance for future access.

This dual local-cloud approach not only optimizes the development cycle and enhances flexibility but also opens up 
new possibilities. Everything we've built leverages this innovative framework, and we're excited for you to experience
 its benefits.
 
Explore your lab and its features at your own pace:

- The [dashboard](@nav/dashboard) offers a streamlined view for quick access to information you've selected as most
 relevant, providing shortcuts and at-a-glance visualizations tailored to your preferences.
 
- The [environment](@nav/environment) section gives you a comprehensive look at your local server's configuration, 
including which backends are active, the middlewares you've installed, and a tool for exploring logs, among others.

- In the [components](@nav/components) area, you can review everything that has been utilized and effectively 
'installed' on your PC up to this point.

- The [projects](@nav/projects) section is dedicated to your work-in-progress projects, which you are preparing to 
publish as componentsâ€”first locally on your PC, and subsequently to the wider online ecosystem for community access.

<!--
* **Browser-Based Applications**: Our platform hosts "executable blocks" as independent units that dynamically link 
together to function within a browser. These units, known as 'components,' create an ecosystem easily utilized by
 applications or scripts to form a coherent run-time.

* **Collaboration**: Integrating work from others into your projects is seamless with YouWol. 
Powered by an online ecosystem, updates are published and can be automatically integrated as needed. 
This ecosystem also features **assets** - conceptualized as 'projects' - which can be automatically retrieved 
when necessary.

* **Performance**: Requested resources are automatically downloaded to your PC, turning it into an 
additional cache layer to avoid unnecessary downloads and enhance performance.

* **Flexibility**: Our diverse array of component types ensures the most effective solution for any given problem.
 This includes JavaScript and its related languages, as well as C/C++/Rust/*etc.* through WebAssembly,
  Python in the browser via Pyodide, and Python backends.

* **Development Cycle**: The workspace is engineered to incorporate the versions of the components you're working 
on effortlessly. Once you publish your package to your PC's database, it becomes accessible to the dependency resolver 
and is linked accordingly. Moreover, several options are available to facilitate development servers for application or
 backend development.
 
## Example

In a nutshell, it comes down to:
\`\`\`javascript

await youwol.install({
    modules:['react'],
    python: ['numpy', 'pandas'],
    backends: ['scipy_backend']
})
// At that point all of the above dependencies are ready to be used
\`\`\`

                 `,
                router,
                views: {
                    logo: () => new CoLabLogo({ router }),
                },
            }),
        ]
    }
}
document.getElementById('content').appendChild(
    render({
        tag: 'div',
        class: 'h-100 w-100',
        children: [
            new Views.DefaultLayoutView({
                router,
                name: 'iLab',
                topBanner: ({ displayMode$ }) =>
                    new TopBannerView({
                        router,
                        appState,
                        displayMode$,
                    }),
            }),
        ],
    }),
)

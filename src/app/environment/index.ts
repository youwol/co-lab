# Environment

<info>
This page gathers information that summarize the environment defined from the 
youwol's [configuration file](@nav/environment/yw-configuration).

## Dispatches

<info>
Dispatches are often used to redirect incoming request to applications or backends to a dev. server.

This is useful in development mode as it allows to skip repeated build & publish steps.

For more information visit:

*  ${pyYwDocLink('CdnSwitch', '/references/youwol/app/environment/models.flow_switches.CdnSwitch')}:
Switch to redirect incoming request to a front-end app in the CDN to a live server.

*  ${pyYwDocLink('RedirectSwitch', '/references/youwol/app/environment/models.flow_switches.RedirectSwitch')}:
Switch to redirect incoming request matching a predefined base path to another base path. Useful for instance for 
backends.
